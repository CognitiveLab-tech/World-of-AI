In this project we would try to analyse Customer Segmentation for a Mall and create a ML model using clustering algorithms.


Tasks Performed :-

5. Plotting the clusters for both the models

6. Findings

Conclusion:- Hence, this project we are able to understand the customer's purchasing power for the mall's good and we can create a Marketing Strategy
