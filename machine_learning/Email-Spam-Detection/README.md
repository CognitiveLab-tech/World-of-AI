# Email Spam Detection using Natural Language Processing

This project aims to build a machine learning model for classifying emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). The model utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text content of emails and make predictions.

## Features

The following features are used for training the machine learning model:

- Bag-of-words representation: Emails are converted into numerical feature vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique.

- Text cleaning: Emails are preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and perform stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.
