**PROJECT TITLE**

# Game-Of-Thrones-Personality-Matcher ⚔️

**GOAL**

The concept of a "personality matcher" does not exist within the context of the Game of Thrones series or any official Game of Thrones game. However, if we were to imagine a fictional personality matcher within the Game of Thrones universe, its main goal would likely be to pair characters with similar personality traits or compatibility for various purposes, such as alliances, friendships, or romantic relationships.

The purpose of such a personality matcher would be to enhance storytelling and character dynamics within the Game of Thrones universe. It could serve as a tool for the writers or game developers to create interesting and engaging interactions between characters, exploring the potential conflicts or alliances that could arise based on their personalities.

Additionally, a personality matcher could be used as a gameplay mechanic in a Game of Thrones video game, allowing players to make strategic decisions based on character compatibility. Players might have to consider the personalities of different characters when forming alliances, selecting companions, or even managing political or military strategies.

Overall, the main goal and purpose of a personality matcher in the Game of Thrones universe would be to add depth and complexity to the interactions and relationships between characters, enhancing the narrative and gameplay experience.

**DESCRIPTION**

The Game of Thrones Personality Matcher is a project that aims to create a system for analyzing the personalities of Game of Thrones characters and matching them based on compatibility. Its purpose is to enhance storytelling and gameplay by generating recommendations for alliances, friendships, and romantic relationships between characters. The project involves conducting personality assessments, analyzing compatibility, and developing a matchmaking system.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

->Collected the dataset from the kaggle
->Applied t-SNE Algorithm on the dataset(To visualize the data that converts the high dimensional data to lower dimensional data while retaining the information)
->Created app.py file which is hosted using Streamlit


**MODELS USED**

T-sne Algorithm

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm commonly used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. It is particularly useful for visualizing complex datasets with nonlinear relationships.

In simple terms, t-SNE takes a set of data points with multiple features and maps them to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the relationships between the points. It does this by modeling the similarity between data points as probabilities and aims to minimize the divergence between these probabilities in the higher-dimensional and lower-dimensional spaces

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn

**VISUALIZATION**

INCLUSION OF IMAGES OF THE VISUALIZATION IS MUST (RESULT OF EDA).

**ACCURACIES**

The model givs accuracy upto 95.3%

**CONCLUSION**

The Game of Thrones Personality Matcher project aims to enhance storytelling and gameplay within the Game of Thrones universe by analyzing the personalities of characters and generating recommendations for their relationships. By utilizing a comprehensive personality assessment and a compatibility analysis algorithm, the project seeks to create engaging interactions and dynamic relationships between characters.
