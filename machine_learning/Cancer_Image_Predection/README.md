### Cancer Image Detection With PyTorch 

## GOAL

This project involves using deep learning and computer vision techniques to develop an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches obtained from larger digital pathology scans.

## DATASET

The dataset using for this project will be comprising of Positive Cell Adenocarcinoma Margin (PCAM) images.
